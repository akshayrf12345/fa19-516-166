# DataCenter

:o2: please can you put the assignment labels as `##` headlines

:o2: d not use the word "I"

I decided to find information about the Google data center in Council
Bluffs, Iowa. There are two Google data centers there, the first of
which opened in 2008, and the second announced in 2012. I focused on the
second data center, though the PUE is roughly the same for both of them
(1.09 vs 1.11). In this area of the country, the dollar per kWh is $.09.
I was not able to find the IT workload of the center, but I estimated it
to be around 9000 kW based off of comparisons to other data centers.
When all of this is put into the CO2 calculator hosted by Schneider
Electric, the annual electricity cost is $7.86 million and the total CO2
output is 77,429 tons.


One thing I thought was interesting was Google's outreach to the
community in Council Bluffs since they built the data center there. The
Google page for the site mentions that Google has awarded $2 million to
local schools and nonprofits, as well as creating a free WiFi network
for everyone in the area. Of course these are probably part of some
agreement with the city and Google to benefit Google on breaks, but I
found it interesting nevertheless
